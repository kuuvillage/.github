## About us

**"空(kuu)"── A space that embraces everything, bound by nothing.**

**kuu village** is an initiative of **co-living program** where participants immerse themselves in the worldview of "kuu" through daily life. It serves as a living laboratory that combines an off-grid lifestyle with decentralized technologies to simultaneously explore autonomy, collaboration, and circularity. Participants let go of attachment to ownership and hierarchy, co-creating shelter, energy, water, food, and governance through their relationships with others. The insights and outcomes gained from this experience are shared as open source and passed on to the next community.

**kuu village is an experimental village where people experience "空-Kuu-" in different locations and pass on their insights like a baton to the next site.** In kuu village, a diverse group of participants from Japan and abroad stay locally for weeks. They engage in co-creation with the local community. The outcomes and learnings generated are shared openly, while also being rooted in the local area.

Each pop-up village continues to serve as a hub for both the participants and local residents even after the program ends, functioning semi-permanently. As the program travels from one location to the next, resilient communities and fields begin to emerge across regions—eventually growing into an interconnected network.
